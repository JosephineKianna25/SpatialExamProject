# Mapping accessibility of Electric Vehicle Charging Services for Trans-European Travel

## Project description 
This repository contains the contents of the final exam project in the course Spatial Analytics at Aarhus University in 2025.
All resources and materials needed in order to replicate our code is to be found in this repository.

In this project, we investigate the feasibility of travelling with an electric vehicle (EV) within a 2000 km radius south of Aarhus, Denmark. 
We selected four destination cities and analyzed which of these were the most accesible, based on time-effiency, hospitality points and EV charging infrastructure along the routes.
easiest, most time-saving and/or consumer-friendly.

## Content and Repository Structure
All necessary files to reproduce the analysis are included in this repository. 

The main script is `Hospitality_map_&_EDSI.R` and should be run from start to finish. 
Data is loaded directly in the script and results are also generated in the script. 

## Usage and Technical Requirements
To reproduce the results, we advise you to clone the repository.

1. Execute this from the command line: 

``$ git clone https://github.com/JosephineKianna25/SpatialExamProject.git``

2. Open the script Hospitality_map_&_EDSI.R in RStudio and run it from top to bottom. 

You will need R installed with the required libraries. A list of necessary packages is included in the top of the script.
